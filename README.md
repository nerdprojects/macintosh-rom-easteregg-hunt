This repo contains scripts, that I used to search for hidden pictures in Macintosh ROM dumps.

See https://nerdprojects.ch/projects/iici-easteregg-hunt/ for detailed description.

- extract_bitfield.py -> Searches and extracts scrambled PICT1 / PICT2 data
- extract_PICT1.py -> Searches and extracts PICT1 data
- extract_PICT2.py -> Searches and extracts PICT2 data
- IDA -> IDA Pro names for ROM and RAM locations of the Macintosh IIci
