# Macintosh ROM Easteregg Hunt
This repo contains scripts, that I used to search for hidden pictures in Macintosh ROM dumps.

- extract_bitfield.py -> Searches and extracts the specially encoded PICT data, as used on IIci and Quadra ROMs
- extract_PICT1.py -> Searches and extracts PICT1 data
- extract_PICT2.py -> Searches and extracts PICT2 data
